About Chicktron<br><br>
Chicktron became a thing in 2017 for my sexy Discord server called Blue Ball Machine Topia. It had a high member count of 4 people! 2 of which were bots. Chicktron didn't do anything back then because I didn't know bots had to be programmed, I expected him to do stuff by himself.<br>
Chicktron is written in Python using various libraries, most notably the discord library. It is written with the quality of the art of spaghetti coding.<br>
I recommend you to set his role color to <span style="color:#c3f794">#c3f794</span>, I think it fits his PFP nicely. I also recommend you to turn off any permissions for pinging @everyone, smart people can use c!say @everyone to ping people (scary!)<br><br>
Start off with c!help in a Discord server with Chicktron. From there, you can find every command!

<p><q>No, u, bot loves you.</q> - No u bot<br><br><br>
No u bot is the latest and most "hip" and "cool" therapy bot. You can always talk to him (except for when he's down) in his DMs or speak with him in front of everyone by pingning him in your message. No u bot is alway there for you.<br>
Need a friend? Look no further than No u bot. Talk about anything with him. He shall listen.<br>
Here are his current commands:<br>
- bruh: moment<br>
- no u bot give me therapy: gives you certified No u bot therapy right in the comforts of a Discord voice channel. For advanced functionality, (choosing the language, making it longer and downloading his sexy voicelines) do "no u bot give me therapy readme"<br>
- @No u bot: ping him to get him to talk! Using super advanced AI technology, you can now ask him about his day, the status of global warming, the intelligence of monkeys or about his opinion on Chicktron! + many other things, of course. (Eggs & Chickens BotLabs has no control over what No U bot says)<br>
- DM Messaging: you can text with No u bot in his DMs for that private therapy/texting experience!
And many more hidden commands!<br><br><br>
About No u bot<br><br>
The Discord application for No u bot was supposed to be a bot for my server Larry's Barbecue named Veliki Grill.lul. The bot never really worked and it just became a dead bot. But when I was about to create No u bot, I remembered this and decided to reuse the bot. No u bot first started as a spambot (one of his codenames is "SpamBotw") spamming the phrase no u into a channel where Chicktron had to reply with no u (as is the rule). I then gave him some special functionality (such as basic chatting and replying with moment when you say bruh). While researching sound for Discord bots, I used the No u bot to test out sound in voice channels, and as a placeholder I made him do some basic therapy. And that's how that function was created. How did I come up with the idea? That's a great question. First, there were only 2 languages (Italian and French), but as we all know today he's loaded with over 15 different languages.
